# tla-bin

tla-bin is a wrapper around https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus that provides
command line binaries for pcal, tlc, tlatex and sany, making automation around TLA+
easy.  Also provides a binary that starts the TLA+ REPL.

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pmer/tla-bin.git
$ ./download_or_update_tla.sh
$ sudo ./install.sh
```

The `install.sh` scripts takes an optional location argument.  By default,
binaries and the tla jar file are installed below `/usr/local`.

## Usage

Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.2E-19
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 8.7E-19
5 states generated, 4 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 4.
